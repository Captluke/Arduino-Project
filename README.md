# Arduino-Project
This is an edge avoiding robot. When an edge is found, 
the infrared sensor module will send a signal pulse to dc motor to reverse and turn
left.

Required component for this project are:
1.2x Infrared Sensor Module
2. L293D Motor Drive Shield for Arduino (Coming Soon)
3. 4x Wheel Car chassis
4. 11V, 2200mAh Lipo Battery
5. Rocker Switch
6. Female to Male Jumper Wire

Happy Coding :)
